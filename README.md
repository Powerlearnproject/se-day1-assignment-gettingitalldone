#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing,testing and maintaining software.It's importance includes:
Enhances efficiency and productivity by following best practices,methodologies and frameworks hence reducing costs and development time.
Encourages teamwork and collaboration especially when handling large software projects since they require collaboration among developers,designers,testers and stakeholders.
Promotes security and reliability since it helps to protect sensitive data,prevent hacking and ensure system reliability by implementing secure coding practices.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering [1968]- The term software engineering was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference.
The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming [OOP] in the 1980s-1990s- The development and widespread adoption of [OOP] with languages like Smalltalk [1972],C ++ [1983] and Java [1995].
The Emergence of Agile Methodologies [2001]- It was published in 2001 by a group of software developers seeking an alternative to traditional Waterfall development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning-defines the project goals,scope,budget,and timeline.
Requirement Analysis-gathers and documents user needs and system requirements.
Design-building the framework.
Coding [Implementation]-uses programming languages,frameworks and tools  to build the software.
Testing-identifies abd fixes bugs through unit testing,and system testing.
Deployment-releases the software to users or clients.
Maintenance and support-provides updates,bug fixes,and performance improvements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate
Waterfall Methodology- Sequential,phase-base
-Rigid,changes are difficult
-Extensive upfront planning
-Customer involvement is minimal until the final product is delivered
-Testing is performed after development is complete
-Waterfall methodology work best for stable,predictable projects.

Agile Methodology- Iterative and incremental with multiple cycles [sprints]
-Flexible adaptive to change
-Continuous planning throughout development 
-Customer involvement is high,with frequent feedback cycles
-Testing is performed continuous throughout the process 
-Agile methodology is ideal for dynamic,evolving ones.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Responsible for designing,coding,testing and maintaining software applications.
-Identifies and fixes bugs or performance issues.
-Updates,optimizes,and refactors code as needed.
-Works with designers,QA engineers,and project managers to build functional software.

Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures that the software meets quality standards by identifying bugs and verifying functionality.
-Designs and runs test cases,including manual and automated testing.
-Ensures software runs efficiently and is secure.
-Tests software updates to ensure they don't break existing features.

Project Manager- Oversees the software development process,ensuring deadlines,budgets and team coordination.
-Defines project scope,timeline,and milestones.
-Identifies potential issues and mitigates them early.
-Acts as a bridge between clients,executives,and the development team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of [IDEs]- Code writing and editing with syntax highlighting and autocomplete.
-Debugging tools to identify and fix errors efficiently.
-Build automation for compiling and running code.
-Integration with VCS,package,managers,and deployment tools.
Examples are:-Eclipse
-PyCharm
-Android Studio
-JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA

Importance of [VCS]- Backup and recovery protects code from accidental loss or corruption.
-Code collaboration,multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work.
-Branching and merging enables developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without conflicts.
-Change tracking maintains a detailed history of changes ,allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
Examples are:-Git
-Mercurial
-Apache Subversion [SVN]
-Perforce [Helix Core]


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software security- Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task.
Solution:Research ways to defend against hacking,malware,phishing,insider and third-party threats.

Software Accessibility and Usability- Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users.
Solution:Use scalable architecture,emphasize reliability.

Balancing quality with speed- The pressure to deliver quickly can compromise code quality.
Solution:Use automated testing and continuous integration [CI/CD] to catch errors early.

Managing technical debt- Shortcuts in development can lead to long-term maintenance issues.
Solution:Follow bes coding practices such as SOLID principles and code reviews.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- Tests individual components or functions of a software application in isolation.Usually written by developers using testing frameworks.
-It catches bugs early in the development cycle and reduces debugging time later in the project.

Integration Testing- Tests the interaction between multiple components or modules to ensure they work together correctly.
-It identifies communication issues between different parts of the system and prevents data mismatches or broken dependencies.

System Testing- Evaluates the complete software system to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements and it is conducted in an environment similar to production.
-It validates that the entire system functions as intended and checks overall performance,security and compatibility.

Acceptance Testing- Determines whether the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.It can be done by end users or clients.
-It ensures the software aligns with the business goals and provides the final approve before going live.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering involves crafting clear,precise and structured inputs to guide the AI's response towards a desired outcome.It's importance includes
Enhances response quality-well-designed prompts lead t more accurate,relevant and useful responses from AI.
Improves efficiency and productivity-saves time by reducing the need for multiple clarifications.
Enables customization and control-tailored prompts help users fine-tune AI responses based on their needs.
Reduces bias and misinterpretation-carefully designed prompts can mitigate AI-generated errors and biases by providing context and constraints.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about technology.
Explain three major technological advancements in the past decade and their impact on daily life.
More specific- Instead of a broad request about technology,it focuses on advancements in the past decade.
Clear expectations- The user wants three advancements,making the response structured and relevant.
Concise and direct- Avoids unnecessary ambiguity,ensuring a precise and focused AI-generated response.
Contextual Relevance- The improved prompt asks for the impact on daily lide,making the response more practical and insightful.
